<h1>A Variable Fonts Primer</h1>
<h2>Get into variable fonts</h2>
<p class="lede">Welcome to the biggest revolution in type since Gutenberg. Variable fonts let you add nuance and artistry to your web typography without bogging down your site. Now you can accomplish what used to require several files with a single file and some CSS!</p> 

<p>The goal of this site is to show you how variable fonts tick. Discover how they can benefit user interface (UI) design, accessibility, and long-form reading, and how they push the boundaries of skillful typographic expression on the web. Some registered and custom axes appear on the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about-variable-fonts">Designing with Variable Fonts page</a>. Deeper explorations of how variable fonts can benefit UI design, accessibility, performance, and readability are covered separately [links to these pages to come]. You can also find details on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/implementing-variable-fonts">implementing variable fonts</a> in a separate section. Once youâ€™ve wrapped your mind around the basics, you can dig deeper into <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/variable-font-resources">other resources</a>.
